          illustrations.</em></p>
      <p>A mix of pink and violet, dusty rose is a gentle, subdued color. While not overly showy, this particular shade
        of
        pink embodies a sense of maturity that allows it to stand on its own while also pairing well with others. Since
        every <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/design/discover/color-meaning.html">color has a meaning</a>,
        let’s explore what dusty rose symbolizes and how you can use it in your next design.</p>
      <h2 id="the-meaning-of-dusty-rose">The meaning of dusty rose.</h2>
      <p>Dusty rose symbolizes love, affection, tranquility, and timeless elegance. Like many pinks, dusty rose is often
        linked to femininity, yet with a more mature tone than a pastel or bubblegum pink.</p>
      <p>The “dusty” in dusty rose also implies a nod to the vintage — think antique lace, weathered postcards, or even
        old, dusty desert towns. When paired with the right palette, dusty rose can create an old-fashioned or nostalgic
        feel in designs, fashion, interiors, and more.</p>

      <p>Pink and green are complementary colors, so dusty rose naturally pairs well with earthy greens such as sage,
        juniper, or deep emerald for a tranquil and feminine palette. Pair tan, beige, or ivory with dusty rose for an
        antique or vintage flair.</p>
      <p>Since dusty rose symbolizes love, it’s also a popular color choice for weddings as a primary or accent color.
        Elevated, elegant wedding designs may balance dusty rose alongside champagne, moonlight blue, gold, and brown.
